Moreover, you will not be able to get any help or assistance from the developers if you encounter any problems or have any questions.
- **Legal issues:** Nulled themes and plugins are illegal copies of copyrighted software that violate the terms and conditions of the original developers. By using them, you are infringing their intellectual property rights and exposing yourself to potential legal actions. You may also face penalties from your web host or domain registrar if they detect that you are using nulled software on your site.
