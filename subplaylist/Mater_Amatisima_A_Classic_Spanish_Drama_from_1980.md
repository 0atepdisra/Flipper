Mater Amatisima tells the story of MarÃ­a (Abril), a young woman who lives with her wealthy and conservative parents in Barcelona. She is unhappy with her life and feels suffocated by her mother's strict Catholicism and her father's authoritarianism. She rebels against them by having an affair with a married man, Luis (Alterio), who works as a journalist. When she becomes pregnant, she decides to keep the baby and run away with Luis, but things don't go as planned.
 
The film is a poignant and realistic portrayal of the conflicts and contradictions of Spanish society in the late 1970s, when the country was transitioning from dictatorship to democracy. It also explores the complex relationship between mother and daughter, and the role of women in a patriarchal culture. Mater Amatisima won several awards at the Berlin International Film Festival and the Goya Awards, and was praised by critics for its powerful performances and its sensitive direction.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Mater Amatisima is the performance of Victoria Abril, who plays the protagonist MarÃ­a. Abril was only 20 years old when she starred in the film, and she showed an impressive range of emotions and nuances. She portrayed MarÃ­a as a rebellious, passionate, and vulnerable woman who struggles to find her identity and happiness in a hostile environment. Abril received the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival for her role, and she went on to become one of the most acclaimed and versatile actresses in Spanish cinema.
 
Another notable feature of Mater Amatisima is the cinematography by Teo Escamilla, who captured the contrast between the opulent and decadent world of MarÃ­a's parents and the bleak and oppressive reality of Luis's life. Escamilla used natural light and dark tones to create a realistic and atmospheric visual style that enhanced the mood and the message of the film. Escamilla was also nominated for a Goya Award for his work on Mater Amatisima, and he collaborated with other renowned directors such as Carlos Saura and Pedro AlmodÃ³var.
 
Mater Amatisima is not only a film about a personal drama, but also a film about a historical moment. It reflects the social and political changes that Spain was undergoing in the late 1970s, when the death of Franco in 1975 marked the end of a 36-year dictatorship and the beginning of a democratic transition. The film shows the clash between the old and the new values, the conservative and the progressive forces, and the hopes and fears of a nation that was trying to heal its wounds and redefine its identity. Mater Amatisima is a film that speaks to both the past and the present of Spain.
